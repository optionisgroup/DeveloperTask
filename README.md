# Developer Task

You have been asked by a junior developer to code review a small program they have been working on. The program is a stand alone service that processes files on the server and moves them to a new remote location. Please spend some time looking at the code so that you can make recommendations for improvements/changes/praise:

-	Are there any improvements you would make?
-	What advice would you give to the junior developer?
